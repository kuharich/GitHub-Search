# GitHub-Search
An iOS application written using SwiftUI that is able to search through GitHub users using the GitHub 
API: https://developer.github.com/v3/ .

The first screen will contain a search bar that can search through any user on the GitHub website
at the top with a list of results underneath. Each item should contain the avatar image and the username. 
The list view should not be paginated.
